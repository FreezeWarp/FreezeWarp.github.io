				<strong><p>Trey Couvillion: What brings you on the light rail today?</p></strong>
				<p>I’m just coming back from LA for a work trip, just going home.</p>
				
				<strong><p>T:  Nice so what do you do?</p></strong>
				<p>I work in public accounting.</p>

				<strong><p>T:  What is the light rail to you?</p></strong>
				<p>Ahh just a means to get to different places. And I have season tickets to the soccer games so this is how we get there. And it’s nice and I’ve been taking public transportation since I was in college so I’m used to it and really enjoy it.</p>

				<strong><p>T:  Where are you from? From Minneapolis?</p></strong>
				<p>Yeah, suburb. But I’ve been living here for the past two years. Or downtown, that is.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  Did you go to the University?</p></strong>
				<p>Yeah I went to St. Thomas, which is a small private school. But yeah it’s just over in St. Paul.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  So you’re coming from the airport?</p></strong>
				<p>Yep!</p>

				<strong><p>H:  How long were you away?</p></strong>
				<p>I flew out last Sunday, and got back in tonight (Friday).</p>

				<strong><p>H:  So what does coming home feel like?</p></strong>
				<p>Oh it’s nice. I was in LA and that was my first time there. So it was really cool, but it’s always nice to come home and sleep in your own bed.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  What does Minneapolis mean to you?</p></strong>
				<p>Home. Definitely home. It’s where my family’s from, where most my friends are. It’s just, yeah my home.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  What do you love about it?</p></strong>
				<p>Seasons, I gotta say. Being down in LA, it’s always hot down there. And I love the snow, and there’s times that you hate the snow but fall and spring are some of the best times of the year.</p>

					<figcaption>“Towards the end of the night, the culture changes. You got, crazy people, hippie people, drunks, addicts, stuff like that. Some people like to cause fights and all that. So, I would say in the morning, very progressive, business-like people. At night, very slow, but the people change and it’s not for the better.”</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<strong><p>T:  What brings you to the station today?</p></strong>
				<p>The station or the state?</p>

				<strong><p>H:  The state AND the station but whatever the flow is.</p></strong>
				<p>Okay so I go to school in Michigan, and through a family member I heard about an internship with Metro Transit. So for the summers I come here, I do my internship. Hopefully when I graduate I’ll be able to get a job in the council. So I’m here because I’m investing in my future.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  So what is the metro to you?</p></strong>
				<p>I’ll try to do my best to describe it. Humm…it’s small, but yet there’s a lot to do. The people are cool. And great transportation.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  So what do you typically do for Metro Transit?</p></strong>
				<p>I work any large event. So that includes X-Games, Twins games, concerts. I also work maintence shut downs. So whenever there’s things that needs to go on on the track and stuff like that, and we have to shut down X amount of stops, I’m there to assist the customers, to make sure they know where to go. I also post rider alerts and do things for supervisors to make their lives easier.</p>

				<strong><p>T:  And you obviously have enjoyed your job so far?</p></strong>
				<p>Yeah, it’s fun. It works out with my schedule. I mean I really don’t do much besides work over the summer. So I can work as much as I want, or I can take some days off and it really not be a big deal. So it’s very flexible.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  How does working on the metro differ through various times of the day?</p></strong>
				<p>During the day, normally business class people. They’re on the go, they pretty much know what’s going on. So they don’t ask a lot of questions. But it’s very busy. Towards the end of the night, the culture changes. You got, crazy people, hippie people, drunks, addicts, stuff like that. Some people like to cause fights and all that. So, I would say in the morning, very progressive, business like people. At night, very slow but the people change and it’s not for the better.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  Can that be difficult sometimes?</p></strong>
				<p>Yes it can. A lot of times they see that we’re wearing our uniform so if they want to mouth off to us, they know we have something to loose so we’re not going to say anything back. So they do try us a lot.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  Anything else you’d like to say?</p></strong>
				<p>No just thank you for the interview, I feel important today.</p>

				<p>S: It’s open 24 hours and they have mallets and like ch-…errr fries.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  What do you guys get there?</p></strong>

				<strong><p>T:  And so you guys were born and raised in St. Paul-Minn.?</p></strong>
				<p>Mc: Yeah.</p>

				<strong><p>T:  What do you love about the area, the twin cities?</p></strong>
				<p>Mc: Umm I feel like a lot of people know each other, so it’s kind of like a close knit community in that way.</p>
				<p>S: I actually just moved to Madison, Wisconsin. And I’m just back for like the weekend. Yeah, it’s really artistic here. There’s like a diverse amount of people. Like people from many different races and cultures and genders and sexual orientations. And there’s like different communities that you can find here that I really really like. There’s a lot of activism. It’s, like, relativity tight.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  How does it differ from Madison?</p></strong>
				<p>S: Madison is really white. And I go to the University of Wisconsin-Madison so it’s like a PWI and, like, sucks. And in Madison everyone’s just a little more quieter and a little more weird and there’s like no black people unless they attend the University. And it’s just like, Oh I came from this place which is like the second highest Mung population and the first highest Somali population in the country. And then I’m like in this really white, weird place. And so it’s just a total 180.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  Do you miss it?</p></strong>
				<p>S: Yeah, that’s why I’m here. Hahahaha</p>

				<strong><p>T:  Already back?</p></strong>
				<p>S: Yeah I just moved and now I’m back.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  So what are you majoring in?</p></strong>
				<p>S: I’m majoring in community and non-profit leadership with an arts education and youth empowerment focus.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  And what do you do?</p></strong>
				<p>Mc: I’m a musician, and I work in retail during the day.</p>

				<strong><p>T:  And so what does the light rail mean to y’all?</p></strong>
				<p>Mc: A way to get to Minneapolis when the busses aren’t running.</p>
				<p>S: I think there are a lot of problems with the Metro Transit system. Like, I think that the fact that they have their own police department is really not okay. And it’s a weird thing to do and a weird thing to ride. But, we didn’t pay, so it’s fine. Hahaha. I think it’s just a way to fennec, it’s a way to get around. And there’s no bus, there’s no train in Madison. Like, it’s really more convenient than you think it is. It did suck that when they built it a whole bunch of local businesses went out of business, that’s really sad. But it’s convenient.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  Anything else you’d like to say about the twin cities?</p></strong>
				<p>Mc: It’s like, low key, a really cool place.</p>

				</figure>
				
				<strong><p>T:  So what brings you on the light rail today?</p></strong>
				<p>Well, it’s easier for me because I can workout at the Lifetime at Target Center. So for me, you know I’m born and raised in St. Paul. I’ve seen from the conception of the light rail, coming down University. It reminds me when ’94, the Ronald neighborhood in the 50’s and 60’s so it’s like history repeating itself. So, I like taking the light rail. But for me it’s connected to my history, you know?</p>

				<strong><p>T:  What do you do?</p></strong>
				<p>I’m a dean of students at a high school.</p>

				<strong><p>T:  What high school?</p></strong>
				<p>Cretin-Derham Hall</p>

				<strong><p>T:  So what do you love about the St. Paul, Minnieapolis area?</p></strong>
				<p>I like the diversity, to be honest. Just growing up, excuse me, when I was, I remember when we didn’t have any monks. The monk population came in ’75. So I was like 6-years-old. So I’ve been around when we had our first Monk immigrants come and now it’s very fluent in St. Paul. Especially on the light rail when you get into St. Paul. We didn’t have to many Somalis until the late ‘90’s I think. So for me it’s a very vibrant community. And we have a large Latino population on the west side. No…Lake Street. You know West Lake Street. So, for me, almost hitting 50, I’ve seen a lot, so.</p>

				<strong><p>T:  So it’s changed a lot?</p></strong>
				<p>Yeah it’s changed a lot.</p>

				<strong><p>T: So that’s what you…</p></strong>
				<p>That’s what I love.</p>
				
				<strong><p>T:  Anything else you’d like to add?</p></strong>
				<p>For me it’s just peaceful to ride the light rail. I have a car. I just don’t like driving. You know right now I’m just relaxing, you know? It’s easy, you don’t have to worry about parking. It’s a straight shot. And it connects me to my community. You know, I’ve always took public transportation. I don’t know it’s just something different about it. Like, it’s part of me. I mean I like driving, don’t get me wrong, but this is my community. Back and forth. This is the real St. Paul, Minneapolis I think. Does that make sense?</p>

				<p>B: Well, we’re here for the X-Games, but we’re both like locally from here.</p>
				<p>K: Yeah, X-Games is where I’m at right now but I work in downtown Minneapolis. Like I practically like in Minneapolis, like this is where my life takes place.</p>

				<strong><p>T:  What brings y’all on the light rail today?</p></strong>
				<p>B: We’re heading back home. We live in St. Paul.</p>

				<strong><p>T:  So what does the light rail mean to y’all?</p></strong>
				<p>K: Uhh transportation for those who don’t have it.</p>
				<p>B: Yeah it’s like a really good thing for just people who don’t have that access to everything.</p>
				<p>K: Especially in like a smaller metro area than other cities in the United States. Like the light rail makes the world a little smaller for those who don’t have cars.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  What were you guys doing at the X-Games.</p></strong>
				<p>K: We were there for the show!</p>

				<strong><p>H:  What sort of things did you see?</p></strong>
				<p>K: I mean today, in particular, it was the men’s street qualifier for skateboarding and women’s finals for skateboarding. Motocross freesyle, among other things. It was quite the day.</p>
				<p>B: I’ve never really paid attention to any of this stuff. He likes it, so that’s why I came. So I saw a lot of new stuff.
				
				<strong><p>T:  What was the coolest thing y’all saw?</p></strong>
				<p>B: The freaking… the ramp! What was the ramp called?!</p>
				<p>K: Big air?</p>
				<p>B: The big air!</p>
				<p>K: The Mega Ramp.</p>
				<p>B: It was like hundreds of feet tall, and people just went down it. It was like the craziest thing I didn’t even know that was a real thing.</p>
				<p>K: Yeah big air was pretty insane. I’d say for me motocross freestyle was the biggest deal to me. Because I’ve never seen that in person. And just the smell of gasoline in the air and the dirt, like it was just insane. It’s something you can’t describe unless you’re there.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  Why do you guys love Minneapolis? Or St. Paul, I suppose. The Twin Cities.</p></strong>
				<p>K: The Twin Cities? I mean it’s like my home. Like I don’t know anything else. It’s just where I was raised. It’s everything to me.</p>
				<p>B: Yeah it’s home. And I’ve been other places, like I’ve seen a lot of the U.S. And it’s just way more…besides it being my home, like it’s way more homey. Like everyone really makes you feel like you’re supposed to be here.</p>
				<p>K: Yeah the people are a big deal for the Twin Cities. Twin Cities wouldn’t be anything without the people themselves, you know? They make it what it is. It’s bigger than the skyline, it’s bigger than the stone arch, it’s bigger than the river, it’s the people that make the Twin Cities what it is.</p>

				<strong><p>H:  Anything else you guys want to say?</p></strong>
