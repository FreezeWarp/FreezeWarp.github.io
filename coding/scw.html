    <p>For over two years (since Feburary, 2014), I have been the sole maintainer of Finance-Guru Sean Cooper's website. Naturally, Wordpress does most of the grunt work, but I have helped ensure that the site works across mobile, tablet, and desktop interfaces by implementing a theme that uses flexible boxes that selectively wrap depending on screen size. This required marking-up each page's content into flowing groups, and marking up the site's Wordpress navigation and widgets to allow them to be placed in different locations depending on whether a viewer is using a phone, tablet, or full-sized PC.</p>

    <p>General maintenance work also comes with the territory, as I have overseen the site's many Wordpress, PHP, and plugin upgrades, and have delicately configured several WordPress plugins to work best for Sean's needs. Before Wordpress included it's own related posts plugin, for instance, I implemented a seperate plugin that required heavy modifications to its PHP source. Similarly, as an aftereffect of this careful plugin and content balancing, the site now has a fairly strong SEO ranking, reaching the first page on Google.ca for "financial writer" and "finance writer".</p>
