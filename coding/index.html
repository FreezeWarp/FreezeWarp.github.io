    <h1>Coding</h1>

    <h2>Instant Messenger</h2>
    <ul class="materialList">
        <a href="im-api.html"><li><strong>Instant Messenger API</strong> - A culmination of 5 years of my work and... it's basically something an experienced programmer could do in three months. Still, I learned a lot and PHP is a hard language to learn right. Not... actually released yet. Give it a month or two. It's close. For real this time.</li></a>
        <a href="im-html.html"><li><strong>Instant Messenger HTML Frontend</strong> - I'm honestly not even sure what's going to come of this one. All the jQueryUI that I wrote I no longer understand, and it'd be much better to move to bootstrap. I'll probably write a super minimal HTML one + jQuery and call it a day. Won't be released until after the API is done.</li></a>
        <a href="im-java.html"><li><strong>Instant Messenger Java Frontend</strong> - And once the HTML one is done, I'll do this one. Maybe I'll do it in C++ or C# instead. Iunno, it's a few months out still. ...Probably a year.</li></a>
    </ul>

    <h2>Small Projects</h2>
    <ul class="materialList">
        <a href="scw.html"><li><strong>SeanCooperWriter.com</strong> - The website of Finance Guru Sean Cooper, of which I am the sole maintainer. But it's all Wordpress anyway, so there's not actually that much to do.</li></a>
        <a href="blackjack.html"><li><strong>Console Blackjack in C</strong> - A C program that simulates blackjack in the console. Uses delays to establish rhythm, unicode to establish realism (as much as you can get from a console, anyway), and real deck logic to help you learn card counting.</li></a>
